# Malware_Analysis_Course
Malware analysis is a crucial field in cybersecurity, involving the in-depth examination of malicious software to understand its functionality and potential threats. Analysts employ various techniques, such as static and dynamic analysis, to dissect code and uncover the malware's behavior. 

# Static Analysis 
Static analysis involves examining software without executing it. Analysts review the code, file structures, and dependencies to identify potential vulnerabilities or malicious patterns. This method provides insights into the program's design and can help detect known signatures of malware.

# Dynamic Analysis 
Dynamic analysis entails executing software in a controlled environment to observe its behavior in real-time. Analysts monitor system interactions, network activities, and runtime behaviors to identify any malicious actions. This approach is effective in uncovering hidden or polymorphic malware that may only reveal its true nature during execution.
